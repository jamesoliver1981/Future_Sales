# Predicting Future Sales
This is where I document the work I carried out on the Kaggle competition to predict a month of sales for Russian software company 1C.  This work involved exploratory data analysis, data mungung, data cleaning, visualisation, building and tuning machine learning models.  All of this was carried out in Python via Juypter Notebooks.
There were just under 3 years of data provided, at the product and shop level on a daily basis, and with this I need to create a prediction for November for every product and shop combination.  This meant that I needed to generate just over 214k predictions.
The evaluation criteria was Root Mean Squared Error, and the winning entry was 0.79215, and my best entry to date is 1.13087.
